# You Should Think About Some States: Kevin Lynagh

_06/12/18_

Kevin Lynagh is a designer specializing in user interfaces for complex systems. He co-created Subform, a CAD-inspired UI design tool, with Ryan Lucas, which got a thousand backers on Kickstarter. He recently created Sketch.systems, an interactive playground for designing system behavior using Statecharts (hierarchical state machines).

In this conversation, we discuss direct manipulation, Statecharts, challenges of layout engines, visual programming languages, the Clojure community, constraint systems, and the three different types of programmers.
