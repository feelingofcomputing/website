In the spirit of clearly communicating what you're signing up for, this podcast episode is nearly three hours long, and among other things it contains a discussion of a paper by author Mary Shaw titled [Myths & Mythconceptions](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3480947) which takes as an organizing principle a collection of myths that are widely believed by programmers, largely unacknowledged, which shape our views on the nature of programming _as an activity_ and the needs of programmers _as people_ and the sort of work that we do _as a sort of work_, and where by acknowledging these myths the three of us (Mary Shaw primarily, and by extension Jimmy and I, those three people, that's it, no other people appear on this podcast) are able to more vividly grip the image of programming with our mind's eye (or [somesuch](https://aphantasia.com)) and conceive of a different formulation for programming, and in addition to these myths this paper also incudes a number of excellent lists that I take great pleasure in reading, beyond which I should also note that the paper does a job of explaining itself and that hopefully you'll find I've done a similar job, that's the spirit, please enjoy.

No, [we](https://todepond.com) will [not](https://patreon.com/todepond) be [discussing](https://mas.to/@todepond) what [has](https://youtube.com/todepond) changed [about](https://twitter.com/todepond) the [show](https://www.tadiweb.com), because [that's](https://github.com/todepond/) the [bit](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/064)!
