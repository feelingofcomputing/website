Following our [previous episode](/episodes/058) on Richard P. Gabriel's *Incommensurability* paper, we're back for round two with an analysis of what we've dubbed the _Worse is Better family of thought products:_

1. [The Rise of Worse Is Better](https://dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html) by Richard P. Gabriel
2. [Worse is Better is Worse](https://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/worse-is-worse.pdf) by Nickieben Bourbaki
3. [Is Worse Really Better?](https://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/IsWorseReallyBetter.pdf) by Richard P. Gabriel

Next episode, we've got a recent work by a real up-and-comer in the field. While you may not have heard of him yet, he's a promising young lad who's sure to become a household name.

* The [JIT entitlement](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_cs_allow-jit) on iOS is a thing that exists now. **Update**: [Mako Yass](http://makopool.com) kindly [pointed out](https://linen.futureofcoding.org/t/4787501/the-recent-interview-on-worse-is-better-mentioned-that-ios-r) that this JIT entitlement is for macOS, not iOS or iPad OS. We regret the error, and lament Apple's continued refusal to allow their devices to act like _computers_ rather than _appliances_.

* Please, call me Nickieben — [Mr. Bourbaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki) is my father.

* A [pony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pony) is a small [horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse). Also, horses have one toe.

* [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) lets you build cross-platform apps using web technologies. The apps you build in it are, arguably, doing a bit of "worse is better" when compared to equivalent native apps.

* [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a new JS runner that competes somewhat with NodeJS and Deno, and is arguably an example of "worse is better".

* [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) and [swc](https://swc.rs) are JS build tools, and are compared to the earlier [Babel](https://babeljs.io).

* The graphs showing the relative lack of churn in Clojure's source code came from Rich Hickey's [A History of Clojure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD-QHbRWcoM) talk. Here are those graphs:
