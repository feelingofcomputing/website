In the 1990s, [Alexander Repenning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Repenning) created [AgentSheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AgentSheets), an environment to help kids develop computational thinking skills. It wrapped an unusual computational model with an even more unusual user interface, offering a fascinatingly visual way to specify program behaviour. While it's not widely-known in our circles, it inspired many other projects, including Scratch and eToys. Then in 2017, Repenning published [Moving Beyond Syntax: Lessons from 20 Years of Blocks Programming in AgentSheets](https://agentsheets.com/img/educators/20YearsofBlockProgramingLessonsLearned_published.pdf), which covers his findings over the years as AgentSheets evolved and transformed, and gives perspective on block-based programming, programming-by-example, agents / rule / rewrite systems, automata, and more.

This is probably the most "normal" episode we've done in a while — we stay close to the text and un-clam many a thought-tickling pearl. I'm saying that sincerely now to throw you off our scent the next time we get totally lost in the weeds. I hear a clock ticking.

* Lu's talk —and I quote— "at Cellpond", was actually at SPLASH, about Cellpond, and [it's a good talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQgxFuw8f1U), about —and I quote— "actually, what if they didn't give up on rewrite rules at this point in history and what if they went further?"
* Oh yeah — [Cellpond](https://cellpond.cool) is cool. Here's [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvlsJ3FqNYU) showing you how it works.

[Will Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Wright_(game_designer)) is, arguably, the #1 name in simulation games. Well, you might not have caught the fantastic article [Model Metropolis](https://logicmag.io/play/model-metropolis/) that unpacks the (inadvertently?) libertarian ideology embodied within the design of its systems. I'd also be remiss not to link to [Polygon's video](https://www.polygon.com/videos/2021/4/1/22352583/simcity-hidden-politics-ideology-urban-dynamics) (and the corresponding write-up), which lend a little more colour to the history.
