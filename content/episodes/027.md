# 27 - Bringing Explicit Modeling To The Web: David K Piano

_07/17/18_

David K Piano is brining explicit software modeling to the web with his xstate library. He gives talks around the world about statecharts, and is cooking up a new SaaS service that will help developers model and understand their application using statecharts. In this conversation, David and I discuss the benefits of declarative languages, such as CSS, the principle of least power, musical notation, Facebook Origami.
