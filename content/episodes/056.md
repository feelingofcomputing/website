Today on the podcast, Jimmy Miller and Ivan Reese are discussing Doug Engelbart's Augmenting Human Intellect.

This is a cybernetic classic. It's also a source of great angst and pain to your humble narrator. You'll just have to listen. It's a podcast, you know the deal.

This episode is sponsored by two companies that want you to work with them to build amazing things:

* [Theatre.js](https://join.theatrejs.com) — They're making a programming interface that embraces all the "what if programming was created by artists instead of business people" principles I keep rambling on about.
* [Replit](https://replit.com/jobs) — They're embracing every wild idea that crosses their path; most recently, it's AI-powered code generation, so if you have ideas for, well, pretty much any way programming could be better, hit them up.

This episode is unsponsored by one organization that wants you to reshape what it means to be a living being:
