The execution of code, by its very nature, creates the conditions of a "strong legalism" in which you must unquestioningly obey laws produced without your say, invisibly, with no chance for appeal. This is a wild idea; today's essay is packed with them. In drawing parallels between law and computing, it gives us a new skepticism about software and the effect it has on the world. It's also full of challenges and benchmarks and ideas for ways that code can be reimagined. The conclusion of the essay is flush with inspiration, and the references are stellar. So while it might not look it at first, this is one of the most powerful works of FoC we've read: [Interpreting the Rule(s) of Code: Performance, Performativity, and Production](https://law.mit.edu/pub/interpretingtherulesofcode/) by Laurence Diver, 2001.

Next episode, we're having an open-ended discussion about end-user programming. The reading is Bonnie Nardi's 1993 classic, [A Small Matter of Programming](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/655143/a-small-matter-of-programming-by-bonnie-a-nardi/), with the referenced articles from the 1991 Scientific American special issue [Communications, Computers and Networks](https://archive.org/details/communicationsco0000unse_p4x1/page/n3) as extra background.

* [iA Presenter](ia.net/presenter) has a clichéd [video teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppuf6TCfSvo). [Mimestream](https://mimestream.com), a great native Mac client for Gmail, also made [one of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmtKeKRd5kk). Ivan first saw this style of video over a decade ago with [Sparrow](https://vimeo.com/32852176) — and at least this one has a narrative. Occasionally, someone does a playful tweak on the formula, like [this video that keeps getting interrupted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEXRx5wZ-cw) for Dark Noise. But in general, this format is worn out, and it was never great to begin with.
* Here's the classic [Atom 1.0 announcement video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7aEiVwBAdk)
* [Very Bad Wizards](https://verybadwizards.com) and [If Books Could Kill](https://www.patreon.com/IfBooksPod) are podcasts that talk through a work from beginning to end sprinkling in reflections as they go, rather than jumping around randomly or separating recap from reflection.
* [Speech act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_act) has a philosophy corner within the philosophy corner. [Elephant 2000](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/elephant.pdf) by Lisp creator John McCarthy, and [Dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org), both make use of speech acts.

* [Hollow Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollow_Knight) is a great game for a 4-year old, and a 40-year old. It's just a great game. Maybe the greatest? [Doom Eternal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_Eternal), not so much — but [the inventive soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4FNBMZsqrY) absolutely slays.

* Tony Gilroy's [Andor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)) and Terry Gilliam's [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_(1985_film)). In hindsight, I'm surprised we made it all the way to the final minutes of the show before mentioning Brazil.
