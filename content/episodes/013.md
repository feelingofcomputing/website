# Episode 13 - Teaching Elm To 4th Graders: Christopher Anand

Most people consider ML-based langauges like Elm hard enough to learn as an adult. But according to Professor Christopher Anand of McMaster University, they work really well to introduce Computer Science to children, starting in 4th grade! In this episode, Christopher and I explore the difference between alegbraic thinking and computational (or sequential) thinking, and why this is incredibly relevant today as the "coding for all" movement 
gains traction.
