$ [patreon.com/futureofcoding](https://www.patreon.com/futureofcoding) — Lu and Jimmy recorded an episode about Hest without telling me, and by total coincidence released it on my birthday. Those jerks… make me so happy.

* Lu's talk at SPLASH 2023: [Cellpond: Spatial Programming Without Escape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQgxFuw8f1U)
* Gary Bernhardt's talk [Wat](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat)
* [Inventing on Principle by Bret Victor ("""Clean""" Audio)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGYGl_xxfXA)
* [Braid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid_(video_game)), the good video game from the creator of [The Witness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZokQov_aH0)
* [David Hellman](davidhellman.net) is the visual artist behind [Braid](http://braid-game.com), [A Lesson Is Learned but the Damage Is Irreversible](http://www.alessonislearned.com), [Dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org), and… the Braid section of Inventing on Principle.
* [Light Table](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ibdknox/light-table) by [Chris Granger](https://chris-granger.com/resume/)
* [Learnable Programming](https://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/) by Bret Victor
* When Lu says "It's *The Line*", they're referring to this thing they're working on called Seet (or "see it"), and you can [sneak](https://github.com/TodePond/TodePondDotCom/blob/main/lab/readme.md) a peek at seet right [heet](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/see-it/prior-art/).
* [Paris Fashion Week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Fashion_Week) absolutely struts, and so can you!
* The [Canadian Tuxedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_jacket#Canadian_tuxedo). As the representative of Canada, I can confirm that I own both a denim jacket and denim pants. If you see me at a conference wearing this combo, I will give you a hug.
* Jimmy runs a personal [Lichess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichess) data lake.
* [Hot Module Replacement](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24581873/what-exactly-is-hot-module-replacement-in-webpack) is a good thing.
* [Pygmalion](https://instadeq.com/blog/posts/no-code-history-pygmalion-1975/) has a lot of juicy silly bits, 'parently.
* [Cuttle](http://cuttle.xyz) is awesome! It's a worthy successor to [Apparatus](http://aprt.us).  [Toby Schachman](http://tobyschachman.com), [Ryan Alexander](https://onecm.com/v4/), and [Forrest Oliphant](https://www.forresto.com)! Crushing it. Oh, and don't miss [Toby's episode](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/051) of this very podcast!
* [Recursive Drawing](http://recursivedrawing.com), another Toby Schachman joint.
* [Screens in Screens in Screens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4OIcwt8vcE), another Lu Wilson joint.
* [Larry Tesler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Tesler). Not a fan of modes.
* Lu writes about [No Ideas](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-wikiblogarden/no-more-ideas/) on their [blog](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/), which is actually just a [wiki](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/), but it's actually a [blog](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/), but it's actually just a [garden](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/).
* When we mention [Rich Hickey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Hickey), we're referring to the talk [Simple Made Easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/)
* [Jacob Collier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Collier), ugh.
* [Suffragettes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffragette), women advocating for their [right to vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage), absolutely had a principle. Not sure that we should be directly likening their struggle to what we do in tech. On the other hand, it's good to foster positive movements, to resist [incel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incel) and other hateful ones.
* Instead of linking to `e/` anything, I'm just gonna link to [BLTC](https://www.bltc.com) for reasons that only make sense to longtime listeners.
* [Stop Writing Dead Programs](https://jackrusher.com/strange-loop-2022/) by [Jack Rusher](https://jackrusher.com). [Jack Rusher](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/041)? [Jack Rusher](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/069)!
* [It's the fish one, the one with the fish. …Sorry, these aren't actually fish, or something, because they're just drawings.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMklf0vUl18)
* [René Magritte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/René_Magritte) is the creator behind [La Trahison des Images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images), origin of "Ceci n'est pas une pipe". Or maybe it was [Margit the Fell Omen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9MQe7tR5xQ)?
* Magritte's [Words and Images](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k58451673/f38.item.r=les) are lovely. Here's an [English translation](http://www.philosophical-investigations.org/2017/12/representing-reality-magritte-on-words.html), though its worth taking a look at the original in context.
* [Acousmatic Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acousmatic_music)
* Lu has made art with behaviour — various [sands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDyvjkAs5-Y), and [CellPond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvlsJ3FqNYU), say.
* [Barnaby Dixon? Barnaby Dixon. Barnaby Dixon! Barnaby Dixon!!](https://www.youtube.com/user/barnabydixon)
* You can listen to part of Ivan's ["""Metronome"""](https://raised-sixth.surge.sh), if you want. Or you can listen to an [early version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoP1bg1GQTM) of the song he's using this metronome to write. Or you can hear snippets of it in the [Torn Leaf Zero video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FgAHiI3ZNY) (especially the ending). But, like, you could also go make yourself lunch. I recommend mixing up a spicy peanut sauce for your roasted carrots. Shred a bit of cheese, tomato. Toast the bread. Pull the sausages right when the oil starts to spit. Put them straight into the compost. Look at the bottom of the compost bucket. What's down there? It's shiny. Why are you reading this? Why am I writing this? Why do we make *this* podcast?
* [Wintergatan  — Marble Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvUU8joBb1Q) exists
* Oh, I forgot to add a link to [Arroost](https://arroost.com) earlier. You can also watch a pretty good video that is basically an [Arroost tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNBKdU6XrLY), not much to it. There are also some nice examples of [things people have made with Arroost](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/arroost/examples/).
* The [Rain Room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_Room) looks [pretty cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkvazIZx-F0). It's the exact inverse of [how rain works in many video games](https://www.polygon.com/23890979/starfield-rain-effects-how-its-made). YOU MUST PLAY [RAIN WORLD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0L-JzJhZbM).
* Here's a [beautiful demo of a microtonal guitar](https://youtu.be/iRsSjh5TTqI?feature=shared&t=188), and speaking of using complex machines to make music that would be "easier" to make with a computer, here's a [microtonal guitar with mechanized frets that can change the tuning dynamically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbbyikFthEc). This entire YT channel is gold.
* Shane Crowley wrote [a lovely blog post](https://edibotopic.com/blog/doing/leisure-sick/) about creating music with Arroost.
* [blank.page](https://blank.page) is a fun experiment in writing with various frictions.
* [Super Meat Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Meat_Boy) (the successor to Meat Boy, a Flash game) and [Celeste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeste_(video_game)) are great examples of communicating tacit knowledge through the design of a simulation.
* [Newgrounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrounds) and [eBaum's World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBaum%27s_World) and [Homestar Runner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestar_Runner) were early examples of (arguably) computer-native media.
* Hey, here's this episode's requisite link to the [T2 Tile Project](https://www.youtube.com/@T2TileProject) and [Robust-First Computing](https://www.andrewwalpole.com/blog/an-introduction-to-robust-first-computation/). I should probably just create a hard-coded section of the episode page template linking to T2, The Witness, and Jack Rusher.
* The pun-proof [Ivan Sutherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Sutherland) made [Sketchpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad). [Planner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planner_(programming_language)) exists.
* The [PlayStation 3 Cell processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3#Technical_specifications) was this weirdly parallel CPU that was a pain in the butt to program.
* The [SpaceMouse](https://3dconnexion.com/ca/spacemouse/)

Put all metal back into the ground.

Music featured in this episode:
* Fingers from [This Score is Butt Ugly](https://ivanish.ca/this-score-is-butt-ugly/)
* [The Sailor's Chorus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1NyYT31Tw) from Wagner's The Flying Dutchman.
