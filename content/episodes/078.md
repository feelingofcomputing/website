One of the biggest goals of this show — our raisin detour, if you will — is to encourage people to look at computer programming differently. It's not just a job, or a way to make the computer do what you want. Code isn't just the material you sculpt into apps and games and websites. The very act of programming itself, and the languages we make and use to do that programming, reflect who we are as people. Programming languages say something.

Esolangs — esoteric programming languages — are programming languages created for these more self-reflective purposes. To some, they're defined by what they're not: not for serious use, not for education, not for efficiency. To others, they're a bunch of funny jokes that people can commiserate through after suffering the steep learning curve of becoming a programmer. A few find in them an opportunity to explore strange computational models, or baffling syntax designs. But is there more to them? Could there be?

In this episode, we're discussing a preprint of the paper [Let's Take Esoteric Programming Languages Seriously](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15327v1) by Jeremy Singer and Steve Draper, and struggling with what it even means to give esoteric languages their due.

$ Each of these episodes is a labour of love. If you appreciate that labour, slip us a five on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/feelingofcomputing). As is the norm, you'll get a second RSS feed with a bonus episode each and ev-er-y month. Except this month, there's actually two (2) bonus episodes, for the simple reason that this podcast swells with bubbles of hot waxy fluid that spill the container of my Ableton Live when they pop. The first pop is a half hour cut from this esolangs ep, the three of us brainstorming esolangs we'd enjoy, super casual and playful, perfect for building your parasocial podcast relationship, you'll love it. The second bonus, as I'm sure you've been expecting, is three hours of Jimmy and I relaying our experiences with Silksong, unpacking its few contentious design decisions, fawning over exquisite details, the good shit. So yeah, hand us one hundred nickles, help Ivan repair his basement, enjoy more of… whatever this is.

- [Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) and [Whitespace](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Whitespace) are two canonical esolangs.
- Our episode on [Structure of a Programming Language Revolution](https://feelingof.com/episodes/058/), which includes extended discussion of Ivan's father-in-law's lookalike.
- [Dreamberd](https://github.com/TodePond/GulfOfMexico) is one of Lu's Esoteric programming languages, which has a (let's just say) "interesting" relationship with AI.
- [The Story of Mel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Mel)
- [Piet](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Piet), [Befunge](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge), and [Malbolge](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Malbolge) are more classic, oft-cited esolangs.
- [Fractran](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Fractran) deserves special mention, since the language is comprised entirely of fractions, which is pretty neat.
- [MarkovJunior](https://github.com/mxgmn/MarkovJunior) _also_ deserves special mention. Seriously, go look at the examples. Wild stuff. It's by Maxim Gumin, who also did the famous [WaveFunctionCollapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse) project.
- We did an entire interview episode about [Orca](https://feelingof.com/episodes/045/) with creator [Devine Lu Linvega](https://xxiivv.com), who more recently made [Tote](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/tote.html), a reversible rewriting sandbox.
- [Reversible computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_computing), something Ivan is [particularly](https://mastodon.social/@spiralganglion/112282956696254310) [interested](https://mastodon.social/@spiralganglion/112284014138207711) in.
- XKCD's comic [X](https://xkcd.com/2309/), about a programming language that uses fonts creatively.
- [ArnoldC](https://esolangs.org/wiki/ArnoldC) is one of _those_ esolangs, like [Shakespeare](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Shakespeare), [Chef](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Chef) (which, actually, is kinda good actually _if_ you actually have to eat whatever you code), or [LOLCODE](https://esolangs.org/wiki/LOLCODE)
- [Wat](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat); still hits.
- [Bodyfuck](https://esoteric.codes/blog/bodyfuck-gestural-code)
- [Evil.css](https://github.com/tlrobinson/evil.css/), "subtle and not-so-subtle CSS rules that will slowly drive people insane"
- [Hest](https://ivanish.ca/hest/) doesn't exist.
- [Code golfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) is the practice of making your code as succinct as possible, often at the expense of readability (though it leads certain people to write really good coffeescript). The [International Obfuscated C Code Contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Obfuscated_C_Code_Contest) is related, in that it's about writing C code where *un*readability is the goal.
- Jimmy would like to challenge _y'all_ to write [Fizz Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) with no booleans, no conditionals, no pattern matching, or other things that are like _disguised booleans_.
- [Arroost](https://arroost.com) is a musical programming environment Lu made to [NORMALIZE SHARING SCRAPPY FIDDLES](https://www.todepond.com/explore/arroost/). [Inform](https://ganelson.github.io/inform-website/) is a natural programming language for interactive storytelling. [PuzzleScript](https://www.puzzlescript.net) is a rewriting language for making tile-based puzzle games. Each of these sits at an interesting spot somewhere on the twisty boundary between the programming meaning of "expression" and the human meaning of "expression".
- The [School for Poetic Computation](https://sfpc.study) occasionally runs a class called [Digital Love Languages](https://sfpc.study/sessions/fall-24/digital-love-languages).
- [Coming Out Simulator](https://ncase.itch.io/coming-out-simulator-2014) and other works by [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me), and [dys4ia](https://w.itch.io/dys4ia) by [Anna Anthropy](https://w.itch.io), are wonderful examples of the sort of deeply personal expression Lu and Ivan would like to see in programming tools.
- What music does Ivan listen to? [Well… here's most of it.](https://www.last.fm/user/sisoft)
- What music does Ivan _make_? [Well… here's some of it.](http://spiralganglion.bandcamp.com) But Jimmy is fond of [Diminished Fifth](https://ivanish.ca/diminished-fifth/), an attempt to make some [shrinking music](https://ivanish.ca/jerk/) with ClojureScript. It's no [Merzbow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merzbow).
- [Zachtronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachtronics) games, like [exapunks](https://feelingof.org/episodes/056) — are they esolangs? A good number of recent videogames have included [conlangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) (constructed languages), such as 2023's fabulous [Chants of Sennaar](https://thinkygames.com/games/chants-of-sennaar/) — but beware of spoilers, as some of [these games](https://thinkygames.com/features/how-fictional-languages-are-perfect-for-the-metroidbrainia-formula/) might use the obscurity of the conlang to hide secrets in plain sight. Minecraft, natch, has a [conlang for enchantments](https://apexminecrafthosting.com/minecraft-the-language-of-enchantment/), and it's worth mentioning that [redstone](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Redstone_components) is an esolang of a sort. And then there's the [Turing tarpit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_tarpit) games, like [Baba is You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Is_You)… the list goes on.
- Perhaps [Tidal Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org) and [Strudel](https://strudel.cc) are esolangs? Perhaps also the [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)?
- [Hedy](https://www.hedy.org) is an unabashed push to do something different!
- Jonathan Richman's [He Gave Us The Wine To Taste It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXUsp0TK6JU&t=308s) is probably my favourite of the various attempts artists have made to plead with their audiences: don't overthink this! (_Friends of the show_ might be familiar with [this one](https://ivanish.ca/dont-do-math/).)
- [Isomorf](https://futureofcoding.org/catalog/isomorf.html) let you view your program with your choice of syntax. It's like Hedy, but less humanitarian.
- [Poe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poes_law) is not [Postel's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle)

Music used in this episode:

- A slice of [Diminished Fifth](https://ivanish.ca/diminished-fifth/).
- The shortest track of [this](https://ivanish.ca/this-score-is-butt-ugly/), the shortest track of [that](https://ivanish.ca/alarum-within/).
- The last song in the episode isn't on the internet, but [the demo](https://ivanish.ca/oven-cleaner/) is.
- Jonathan Richman's [He Gave Us The Wine To Taste It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXUsp0TK6JU&t=308s)
