Today we're discussing the so-called "incommensurability" paper: [The Structure of a Programming Language Revolution](https://dreamsongs.com/Files/Incommensurability.pdf) by [Richard P. Gabriel](https://dreamsongs.com/).

In the pre-show, Jimmy demands that Ivan come right out and explain himself, and so he does, to a certain extent at least. In the post-show, Jimmy draws such a thick line between programming and philosophy that it wouldn't even look out of place on Groucho Marx's face.

Next episode, we will be covering the *Worse is Better family of thought products*, so take 15 minutes to read these three absolute bangers if you'd like to be ahead of the game:

* [The Rise of Worse is Better](https://dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html) by Richard P. Gabriel
* [Worse is Better is Worse](https://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/worse-is-worse.pdf), definitely not by Richard P. Gabriel
* [Is Worse Really Better?](https://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/IsWorseReallyBetter.pdf) by Richard P. Gabriel

While we're here, make sure you've seen [the best 15 seconds in Strange Loop history](https://youtu.be/IOiZatlZtGU?t=2012).

## Sponsors

CarrotGrid — They don't have a web presence (weird, hey?) but they're working on an interesting problem at the intersection of data, so listen to the short ad in the episode to find out more.

[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://tiltify.com/@futureofcoding/future-of-coding) — Instead of running a 2nd sponsor today, we'd like to direct your attention to this humanitarian cause. September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, and our friends (can we call them that?) at Relay.fm are running a pledge drive. If you have any spare coins in your couch cushions, or a few million left over from your last exit, you'd be hard pressed to find a more deserving way to invest them.
