# Learning Programming At Scale: Philip Guo

_02/02/18_

Philip Guo researches ways to scale programming education beyond the classroom. He is the creator of [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/), a widely-used code visualization and collaborative learning platform, and an assistant professor at UC San Diego. In this episode, we discuss why diverse groups of people study CS, his various prototypes, and the differences between technological research and industry.
