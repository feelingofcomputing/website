This is Jimmy's favourite paper! Here's a [copy](https://gist.github.com/onlurking/fc5c81d18cfce9ff81bc968a7f342fb1) someone posted on HitBug. Is it as good as the original? Likely not! Ivan also enjoyed this Theory Building business immensely; don't be fooled by the liberal use of the "blonk" censor-tone to cover the galleon-hold of swearwords he let slip, those mostly pertain to the [Ryle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Concept_of_Mind).

For the next episode, we're reading [No Silver Bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet) by Fred Brooks.

[Stop Writing Dead Programs](https://jackrusher.com/strange-loop-2022/), a talk by Jack Rusher, gets a whole new meaning!

Music featured in this episode:
* [Speed x Distance = Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLk45tpMnU0) by Blonde Redhead from the album [In an Expression of the Inexpressible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_an_Expression_of_the_Inexpressible) which, upon reflection, is actually not Ivan's favourite. That'd be [Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody_of_Certain_Damaged_Lemons).
