## Fun engagement

I've been having some fun engagement! [Spoke with AndreaS from Twitter. Tweeted with Chris Granger, emailed with Alan Kay and Nick Johnstone and Christopher Anand.](http://futureofcoding.org/journal#septempber-29-2017-1206pm)

### I love emails

I'm also getting cold emails from listeners which has been unreal! Please keep it coming and apologies if I'm not able to review your tech right away. I will try to respond within a day or two but it might be just to tell you that I'm busy and will add you to my list. I am human so the more you follow up with me, the faster I will get to your stuff.

## [Juan-Benet-inspired Master Plan](http://futureofcoding.org/journal#juan-benet-insired-master-plan), which I continued on [the about page](/about.html)

## [StreamSheets write up](http://futureofcoding.org/journal#streamsheets-write-up)

## Website reorg

[Journal Death Knell](http://futureofcoding.org/journal#death-knoll-of-this-journal) and future on commit log and [unbreakable-links](https://github.com/stevekrouse/unbreakable-links) ([which may turn into its own github pages alternative service](https://github.com/stevekrouse/unbreakable-links/issues/11))

## [Amazing recent call with Andre Staltz](/notes/andre-staltz-call-10-9-17.md)

### (https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/) is really cool

### Marinate on problems

### Design for the future (AI)

### Strongly Consider Expression Editor or Blockly Alternative (as a subcomponent to prototype other things)

## Plan for next week

### 1\. Continue Master planning (writing and getting feedback)

### 2\. Start writing about problems more explicitly (as opposed to solutions)

- View update problem
- Prototyping graphic languages problem
- Error messages are hard problem
- Files and folders are a tough abstraction to make sense of a codebase problem

### 3\. Continue writing up solutions

- [StreamSheets](https://github.com/futureofcoding/futureofcoding.org/issues/54)
- [FRP WoofJS](https://github.com/futureofcoding/futureofcoding.org/issues/55)
- FRP Scratch
- Blockly Elm
- Blockly CycleJS
- Expression Editor

### 4\. Make this website scale with changes: [unbreakable-links](https://github.com/stevekrouse/unbreakable-links)
