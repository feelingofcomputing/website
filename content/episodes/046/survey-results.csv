It has better support for permalinks, threaded discussions, search, and more, with basically all the features of Slack (including desktop, mobile, and web apps). It's actively developed and is growing in popularity. In the conversations leading up to this survey, Zulip was the most popularly recommended alternative to Slack. So, what if we moved the community to Zulip?","Discourse is like a traditional message board, but features a modern visual design and a fair bit of JavaScript-powered dynamism. It is actively developed and is already quite popular. In the conversations leading up to this survey, it was the second most popularly recommended alternative to Slack. Unlike Slack and Zulip, it is a message board rather than a chat service, which will change the tone, length, and frequency of posts to the community. So, what if we moved the community to Discourse?","The third option is a traditional server-driven message board / forum, something like phpBB. This option is appealing if you prefer a message board to chat (with all the changes to tone, length, and frequency of posts it'll bring), but do not like the modern design or JavaScript features of Discourse (which sometimes get in the way more than they help). So, what if we moved the community to a traditional message board / forum?","Now that you've seen the options, what is your #1 pick?","What would you like to see the community do more of?","Aside from ""release more episodes"", what would you like to see happen with the Podcast?

I would focus on lowering complexity, get computing more into the ""application-less age"", just information and features, drastic openness, modularity, interop, with the goal of helping people access and assimilate knowledge necessary for their thriving at the household and local level.","Can't think of any specific guests I'd like to see, but I'd love to hear more on knowledge management and preservation topics. I feel there is a reservoir of untapped KOS research that could help the productivity of our information wrangling, which for many is in the stone age. Maybe Juan Benet of IPFS etc. to talk about infostructure.","""Future of Coding"" is a vast and fluid notion to me. The most condensed distillation I can come up with is: computing allowed and could further enable crucial social benefits, but this incarnation cannot continue for long. Its baroque complexity makes it way too fragile, and it is operating in an environment of mounting instability which threatens catastrophic knowledge loss. I count as members of the wider Future of Coding community those who recognize the implications of the storm brewing and are working to retool for resilience, under banners such as small is beautiful."
