[Go To Statement Considered Harmful](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/362929.362947) is a solid classic entry in the [X Considered Harmful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful) metafiction genre, authored by renowned computer scientist and idiosyncratic grump, [Edsger Wybe Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra). Surprisingly (given the impact it's had) this is a minuscule speck of a paper, lasting only 1-ish pages, and it even digresses several times from the main point. Fear not! Jimmy and I spend the entirety of these two podcast hours thoroughly analyzing the paper, wringing every last drop of insight from it, speaking directly to how programming ought to be reimagined from the molten venture capital core on up. Yes indeed, this is another episode in the fine tradition of Future of Coding where we stay faithfully close to the text, we leave the second-order implications alone, and there's nothing more than that. Nothing portended, nothing changed.
