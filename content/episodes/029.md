# 29 - Reflection Thirteen: Independent Mentorship

_08/27/18_

My research recap episodes are back! This is the first I've recorded since the end of 2017. I discuss my new mentor-mentee relationship with Jonathan Edwards, my upcoming new paper on functional reactive programming, my move to London, my goals, and other various musings.
