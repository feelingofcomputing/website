# Feeling of Computing

This is the repo for the Feeling of Computing community website: [feelingof.com](https://feelingof.com)

It's just beginning to take shape. Hang tight!

You'll need node, and to `npm i` to fetch deps.

You have `.` in your path, right? Then run `foc` to use the website CLI. Otherwise, run `./foc`

### TODOS (unsorted)

- Add redirects for the old episode link style (eg: `/episodes/60` or `/episodes/6`), or switch to that style and add redirects for the `060` and `006` versions.
- New logo
- Broken link checker?
- Pick a font
- Copy nice styles (like outlines) from the wiki
- Make the code of conduct a page on this site (aka reduce dependence on github)
- Move the wiki to a new domain, or just make it part of this site, or just make the whole site a wiki in that style
- Add OG and various other meta to <head>
