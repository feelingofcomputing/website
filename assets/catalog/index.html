        <p>Over the past year and a half, I've been collaborating with <a href="https://darklang.com">Dark</a> (a new programming language startup) to research programming languages and tools. Today we are sharing these reviews publicly.</p>
        <p>The Whole Earth Catalog was before my time, but I grew up immersed in many of the conversations it began. This series borrows its name, and continues in its tradition of "access to tools". Stewart Brandâ€™s original inspiration for the Catalog was helping his "friends who were starting their own civilization hither and yon in the sticks." This series is likewise designed to help visionary friends, but where his friends were living off-the-grid, my friends are creating the programming environments of the future. This series is democratizing access to tools one-step removed. These reviews are for the makers of tools, those that are pushing our computational interfaces forward. The goal of the Whole Code Catalog is to provide inspiration for the tools you will one day create.</p>
        <p>Other similar efforts to catalog futuristic computational interfaces include:
